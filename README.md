# Netwolf

This is a peer to peer(p2p) program that can identify other clusters and transfer files between them.

To start it you should create a file and a directory for each of your clusters. In the file there should be a list of other clusters and there can be some files in the directory.

when the program starts, you have to identify which cluster it is and then it will start sending discovery messages and afterwards it can request files from other clusters in its cluster list.
